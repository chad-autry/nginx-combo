# web-application cluster boiler-plate
Documentation and copy-pasteable boilerplate for running a full web application in a micro-services style. Many pieces are optional and could be swapped out to match others desires.

### Assumptions and Opinions
* Alpine Linux is my prefered containerized OS, and the choice I've made for images
* CoreOS is the chosen host operating system
  * fleet comes for free for orchestration
  * etcd comes for free for a key value store

### Requirements and Features
* Dockerized nginx container to host static site
  * Forward's nginx logs to the docker service, [loggly logging strategy article](https://www.loggly.com/blog/top-5-docker-logging-methods-to-fit-your-container-deployment-strategy/)
  * Automatically reconfigures and refreshes nginx config based on routing configuration provided through etcd
  * SSL termination
  * By default forward http connections to https
  * Have a configuration mode which allows initial letsencrypt validation over http
  * Oauth & Oauth2 Termination
    * JWT generation and validation
* Https certificate from letsencrypt with autorenewal
* Static Front End boilerplate, with static component upgrade strategy
* Containerized Node.js server with application upgrade strategy
  * Boilerplate to publish to etcd
  * Discovers database from etcd
* Dockerized  RethinkDB
  * Boilerplate to publish to etcd
